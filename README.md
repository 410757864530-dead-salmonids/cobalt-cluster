# cobalt-cluster: A Complete Rewrite of Cobalt Botterfly [WIP]

This is a rewrite of Cobalt, the bot of the Discord server
[Star vs. the Forces of Discord](https://discord.gg/svtfoe). It uses my Cluster framework, along
with some new hopefully-more-efficient coding practices that I didn't follow beforehand.

It is currently still a work in progress -- any crystals (modules) that are complete are found in
src/crystals/main, and any crystals that are unfinished (in progress or not started) are in
src/crystals/dev.

## Current crystal progress

### Finished
